by Katelyn Clemow (art/sound), Ben Dance (art/sound), Lawren Elderkin (GitHub/testing), Juli Solstice (coding)
for MSCH-C220 Game Technology created April 27th, 2020 due April 29th, 2020

This was created as our final project at Indiana University, as well as part of Game Jam - where we only have 48 hours to create an entire, working game. The theme is Coronavirus, given to us by Prof. Jason Francis, but also because of the current Pandemic the world is experiencing right now. 

We decided to create a Tetris-like game that included blocks of Clorox wipes, toilet paper, hand soap, a germ, gloves, and a face mask – only some of the essential items that people are buying in bulk these days. The way we thought of this was just brainstorming. We used Discord to communicate our ideas to one another. Some difficulties we had during the creation of SpaceGodzilla Tetris was creating the tilemap that would fit correctly in the game. We had created the blocks but then had to go in twice and resize and recreate the tilemaps. Although it was an easy fix, due to our group not all being online at the same time, we had to wait between each mistake for the other person to get online. We also had problems during testing. Godot kept freezing on us, so we had to exit the program and reopen it several times. Debugging was also a long process. 

The objective of our game is to move and rotate the falling blocks (Clorox wipes, toilet paper, hand soap, a germ, gloves, or a face mask) to form complete rows to clear the screen before the blocks fill up the page. We used GitHub and Godot to create our game. Our assets (blocks and sounds) were made by Katelyn and Ben. Lawren did the finishing touches such as the read me, thumbnail, and testing the game. Juli did all the coding for the game.

If we were to expand on this game, some future features would include different themed levels with different themed blocks; this would be neat to have during different seasons. Another feature we would eventually include is “free” blocks; these would explode once they hit the bottom row and rid the screen of an entire row of blocks.
